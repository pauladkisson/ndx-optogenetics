# Changelog for ndx-optogenetics

## v0.3.0 (September 23, 2025)

- Refactored the extension to depend on `ndx-ophys-devices` for device and biological component specification, replacing its previous standalone device types. Introduced the `OptogeneticSitesTable` to consolidate stimulation site metadata (excitation source, optical fiber, effector), updated the schema, API, docs, and tests accordingly, and improved modularity for optogenetic metadata.
